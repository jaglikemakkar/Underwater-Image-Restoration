# Underwater Image Restoration


**Hello Underwater World!**
> The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes to see them.
Or in this case, an algorithm

## About the Project
Due to the physical properties of underwater, capturing clear images is challenging.
The effects of absorption and scattering as well as the varying attenuation of light in
different wavelengths cause degradation of underwater images. 

The project aims to restore the color of underwater images using Blue-Green Channels Dehazing
and Red Channel Correction. This is an python implementation of Chongyi Li et.al algorithm for underwater image restoration.

## How to run
* Download and extract the code
* Open main.py file and set path of source and destination path.
* run ```python main.py```
